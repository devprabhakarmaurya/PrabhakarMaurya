            <p> As a versatile web developer, I am skilled in a wide range of technologies that power modern web applications. My expertise includes <strong>HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript,</strong> which form the foundation of every interactive web experience I create. Leveraging the power of <strong>React.js</strong>, I build dynamic and responsive user interfaces that deliver seamless and engaging user interactions.</p>
            <p>To manage and store data, I'm proficient in working with <strong>MySQL</strong> databases, ensuring that data is organized and accessible. I also harness the power of <strong> Node.js</strong> and PHP to develop backend logic that supports the functionality of my applications.</p>
            <p>My goal is to provide comprehensive end-to-end solutions, from front-end design to back-end development. By combining these technologies, I create web applications that are not only visually appealing but also <strong> robust, secure, and user-friendly.</strong> </p>
